Efficient Crowdsourcing-Based Framework for On-Road Weather Detection Using Voting Strategy

Visibility distortions on driverâ€™s visual field caused by extreme weather conditions, such as rain, haze, snow, and so on, can result in a negative impact on the performance of driving tasks. One often seen negative impact is traffic collision which causes significant traffic congestion on urban roads and highways. The work aims at developing a novel crowdsourcing-based framework to specifically detect weather conditions of each urban road and highway in real-world circumstances. Built upon the Google image analysis model, we propose a voting based detection algorithm for multiagent decision problem. The basic idea is to find good candidates within a certain region in spherical trigonometry. Such candidates lead to an accurate decision of weather conditions on current road. The experimental results show that the proposed framework is capable of accurately detecting bad weather conditions under real-world driving scenarios.
